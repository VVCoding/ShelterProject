    <h1> Map of Homeless Population based on Borough for NYC <h1>

    <h3>Takeaways and Interpretations</h3>
    <p>Despite reportedly increased efforts of helping house homeless people, there are still massive amount of homeless people left in the different boroughs of NYC</p>
    <p>Most migrants that ended up in homeless shelters, did so in the The Bronx and Brooklyn. Not only do they have over 10,000 homeless individuals each, but also they, together, make up over 50% of all homeless individuals in the 5 boroughs towards the end of April 2022.</p>
    <p>Due to the higher concentrations of homeless individuals in The Bronx and Brooklyn, most resources and aid should be focused in those boroughs</p>
    <p>It is illustrated above that communities with stereotypically higher homeless populations do actually have some statistics to back up this notional idea</p>
