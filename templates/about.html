    <h1>Who's in a shelter?</h1> 
    <p>This is a graphical representation with the goal of highlighting trends in the demographic of people staying in shelters. Mainly encompassing children, adults, and whole families, this visualization will depict the total amount of each group in a shelter for a any given day from 08/21/2013 to 04/01/2024 along with their yearly averages. </p>
    
    <h2> Data Cleansing Process</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A Data Set was found that could be downloadable as a CSV</li>
        <li>Google Sheets was used to remove any unneccessary columns/rows and to add any other data</li>
        <li>The Google Sheet was downloaded as a CSV</li>
        <li>A <a href = "https://github.com/VVCoding/ShelterProject/blob/main/data/format_data.py">python program</a> was made to go through the data and turn it into a .json file </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Feedback and Takeaways </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Compare Micro data to average statistics</li>
        <li>Perhaps add data to each date on the calendar</li>
        <li>Define Y-axis on macro page</li>
        <li>I instituted a easy-to-use calendar linking all micro pages to an interface</li>
        <li>I used templating, creating one file as a template and pushing data with it to customize the file, to decorate each micro page very simply</li>
        <li>My protoypes below clearly show a neat way of organizing and displaying large amounts of data</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Prototypes</h3>
    <img src = "{{ url_for("static", filename = "IMG_3984.jpg") }}" width = "50%" height = "10%" transform: rotate(90deg)>
    <img src = "{{ url_for("static", filename = "IMG_3985.jpg") }}" width = "50%" height = "10%" transform: rotate(90deg)>

<!-- You might also want to add monthly averages as well for more ground covered, and then you can add a place where people can choose a specific day as well-->
<!--Think about the design-->
